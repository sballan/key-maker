# Key Maker

Key Maker solves very particular problem:

1. You want keys made for arbitrary JavaScript objects.
2. These keys need to be strings, preferably of a short length, and need to be manufactured deterministically.
3. You want to do this in the browser.

To install:
```
$ npm install key-maker
```

Use `dist.js` if you want dependencies baked in.
